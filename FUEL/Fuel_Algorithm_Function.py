### Fuel Algorithm

# Thresold, is the threshold of removal (or change in fuel over the value you want to calculate)
# min_average_spread, is actually the log rate per minute. for 4 second log rate, this value would be a 15 times of logging per minute
# No_fuel, is a true or false, is the data corrupted or not
